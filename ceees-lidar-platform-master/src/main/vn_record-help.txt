Vectornav logging on Raspberry Pi

Need to update python3-dev in order to install vnpy. 
sudo apt-get install python3-dev

if read-only filesystem pops up, enter:
sudo mount -o remount,rw /
or simply type: "fsrw"

The script should be run within screen environment therefore it won't stop after ssh connection is terminnated.

Using screen command:
1. Type "screen" to open a new screen. 
2. cd into "~/sen/vn_record" to go into the working directory. 
3. type "sudo python3 stapla.py"
4. Press Ctrl-A followed by "d" to exit the screen. 
5. Type "exit" to exit the ssh connection. 
6. To re-attach the screen, type "screen -r" to check if program is running.

To archive current files: 
use "tar" and then ssh back the file. (or filezilla) 

To set time for Raspberry Pi: 
date -s "4 SEP 2018 22:42:00"

To set internal ip address:
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0
For this case, use enxb827eb497fca instead of eth0.
